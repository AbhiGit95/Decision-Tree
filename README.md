# Decision-Tree
Decision Tree has been developed using Information Gain as the heuristic.
Information Gain has been calculated using Entropy in 3 models and using Variance in the other 3 models.
The model has been developed based on a dataset for predicting weather.
The model's accuracy is compared using techniques like reduced error pruning and depth based pruning.
The accuracy of the developed decision tree has also been compared with the random forest model of scikit learn for learning purposes.
